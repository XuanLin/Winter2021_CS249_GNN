## Introduction

Finding new chemical compounds with desired properties is a challenging task in de novo drug design. The large space makes most search methods very expensive. Many techniques, such as SMILES, have disadvantages that are hard to overlook. The syntactic rules and strict representation make them difficult to implement. This paper will use implicit methods for molecular graph generation. More specifically, they utilize a generative adversarial network (GAN) and reinforcement learning (RL) objective to generate molecules with desired properties. This work is the first to address the generation of graph-structured data utilizing GANs for molecular synthesis. Discrete graph structures are predicted at once in an efficient manner. With the help of a discriminator and reward network, the generative model is able to work effectively directly on graph structured representations.
