1. (multiple-choice) Which probabilistic logical operators does BetaE support?

a. Projection.
b. Intersection.
c. Negation.

2. (single choice) Assume we have a Beta embedding (a, b), and N is negation operator. What is N[(a, b])?

a. (b, a)
b. (1/a, 1/b)
c. (1/b, 1/a)

3. (True or False)  Although we can model union operators with Intersection and Negation operators (De Morgan's laws), there are still some union-based queries that BetaE cannot model in theory, if the queries are not in DNF.

a. True
b. False
