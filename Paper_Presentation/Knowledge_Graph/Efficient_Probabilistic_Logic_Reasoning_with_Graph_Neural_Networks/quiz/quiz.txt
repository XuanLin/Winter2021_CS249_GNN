1. What is a potential problem for applying GNN-based methods on knowledge graphs? (single choice)

a. There is no potential problem. GNN can perform well on all graph-related problems. 
b. Long-tail nature of Knowledge Graph makes applying GNN hard since GNN requires sufficient labeled instances to achieve good performance. 
c. GNNs cannot be used to infer new links between two existing entities in knowledge graph. 


2. Which of the following is true about Markov Logic Network(MLN)? (single choice)

a. Inference in MLN is computationally intense.
b. The MLN structure is normally sparser than knowledge graph
c. a and b

3. In regards to ExpressGNN, at which step is the GNN used in variational EM for Markov Logic Network(MLN)? (single choice)
a. E step
b. M step
