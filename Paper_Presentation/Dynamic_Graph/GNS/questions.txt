1. (Single-Choice) The update mechanism in GNS adopts which of the following methods to obtain the prediction?

a. Explicit Euler
b. Implicit Euler
c. Semi-implicit Euler


2. (Multiple-Choices) What does the input vector of each particle contains: (abc)

a. Material property
b. External force of the system
c. Position


3. (Single-Choice) Which of the following statements about hyperparameter settings in GNS is correct? (d)

a. Since a larger number of message-passing steps M can yield improved performance, M is suggested to be set as large as possible.
b. Models with shared GN parameters achieve better accuracy than models with unshared parameters.
c. The relative encoder is worse than the absolute version due to the spatial invariance. 
d. Changing the connectivity radius R has similar effects of modifying the number of message-passing steps M.
