1. (Single-Choice) The update mechanism in GNS adopts which of the following methods to obtain the prediction? 

a. Explicit Euler
b. Implicit Euler
c. Semi-implicit Euler


2. 


3. (Multiple-Choices) Which of the following statements about hyperparameter settings in GNS are correct?

a. Since a larger number of message-passing steps M can yield improved performance, M is suggested to be set as large as possible.
b. Models with shared GN parameters achieve better accuracy than models with unshared parameters.
c. The relative encoder is better than the absolute version due to the spatial invariance. 
d. Changing the connectivity radius R has similar effects of modifying the number of message-passing steps M.
