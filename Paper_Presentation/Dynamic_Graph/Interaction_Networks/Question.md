## Question 1. (multi-choice)
Which of following functions need to be learned in the interaction networks? (multi-choice)

A. The marshalling function m

B. The relational function phi_R

C. The aggregation function a

D. The object function phi_O

E. The abstraction function phi_A

## Question 2. (Ture or False)
Interaction Networks is an attributed, directed multigraph because the relations have attributes, and there can be multiple distinct relations between two objects

A. True

B. False

## Question 3. (single-option):
In the experiments of IN, which of the following statements is true?

A. The model trained on 6-body problem performs better than model trained on 3-body problem on the 3-body domain tests.

B. Because the dynamics are highly nonlinear, small prediction errors can lead to large differences in the system state. This will lead to human-perceptible incoherent rollouts.

C. IN only generalizes well to systems with fewer objects, but not those with more objects.
